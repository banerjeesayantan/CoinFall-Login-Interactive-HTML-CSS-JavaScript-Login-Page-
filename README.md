Repository Description:

- A professional, beginner-friendly login page built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript featuring a beautiful animated coin rain background that appears after a successful sign-in.
- Designed to help anyone (even complete beginners) understand form validation, canvas animation, and event-driven JavaScript in one project.



Introduction: 

Welcome to CoinFall Login, a mini front-end project designed to teach you real-world web development concepts in a fun, visual way.


You‚Äôll learn:

- How to validate login forms with JavaScript
- How to animate coins falling using the Canvas API
- How to organize HTML, CSS, and JS like a professional
- How to trigger animations on successful login

That's Why clean structure and UX details matter in real projects.

Even if you‚Äôre new to coding ‚Äî this repo will guide you step by step.



üí° How It Works (Concept Flow) :

- User Enters Credentials
- Email & password fields are validated in real-time.
- Errors are shown cleanly without shifting layout.
- Login Success ‚Üí Coin Animation
- When both fields are valid, a ‚ÄúLogin Successful ‚úÖ‚Äù message appears.
- Then, hundreds of animated golden coins start falling from the top of the screen using the HTML Canvas API.


Reusable Concept: 

- You can change the coin image ‚Üí stars, snowflakes, emojis, etc.
- Or turn this into your own reward login, crypto sign-in, or game landing page.
